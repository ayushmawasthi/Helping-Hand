## Abstract
<p>Communication between specially-abled and abled people can be problematic, inconvenient, and expensive. This project attempts to bridge the communication gap by designing a portable glove that captures the userâ€™s sign language gestures and outputs the translated text on a smartphone.

The main aim of this project is to discuss the novel concept of glove based system that efficiently translates Sign Language gestures to auditory voice as well as text by using hand gestures and also promises to be portable so, problems faced by the disabled person regarding communication can be overcome by our method. This ensures that by using these gloves they can indulge them in an activity where they may say themselves as an independent person.</p>


## Functional Units
> 1. Arduino UNO 
> 2. Flex Sensor 
> 3. NodeMCU (ESP8266 ) 
> 4. Jumper Wires and Resistors 
> 5. Breadboard


## Advantages
> Inhanced Performance
>> - Real time translation
>> - Safety
>> - Customizable

> Comfortable
>> - Easy to Use.
>> - Small Size.
>> - Less strings (wires) attach.
>> - Light Weight 



### Conclusion
<p>This could mean a new way for about 70 million people with hearing and speech impairment to verbally communicate and connect to people around them.
This project aims to remove the communication gap between deaf or mute community and the normal people. </p>

### Future Scope
<p>For the next cycle we are planning to make it directly connected to phone. I mean as of now we are using an intermediate server between two, but using lan-wifi java modules (JavaSocketNetworking) we can send data from Nodemcu to Android phone, and will figure out how to use the ADC module so that Arduino dependency can be removed. At the end in the deployment phase, we can design a PCB as these Arduino or ESP2866 NodeMCU are only for that prototyping phase. But in the end PCB is designed for such projects
